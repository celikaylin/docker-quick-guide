
# External Data Storages
There are two type external data storages which are volumes and bind mounts.
## Volumes

Volumes are folder on your host machine hard drive which are mapped into containers.

⚡️ A container can write data into it and read data from it.

⚡️ Docker sets up a path on your host machine and the exact path is unknown to you.

### Volumes Key Commands

To list volumes
```bash
 docker volume ls
```
To create a volume
```bash
 docker volume create VOLUME_NAME
```
To inspect the volume
```bash
 docker volume inspect VOLUME_NAME
```
To create read-only volumes, you should add *:ro* end of the path
```bash
 docker run -v VOLUME_PATH_IN_THE_CONTAINER:ro IMAGE_NAME
```
To remove specific volume
```bash
 docker volume rm VOL_NAME 
```

To remove unused volumes
```bash
 docker volume prune 
```

### Volumes Types
There are two types of volumes which are anonymous and names volumes.
### Anonymous Volumes
⚡️ Anonymous volumes exist as long as the container exist.

⚡️ Cretad for a container specifically. When the container stops, it can not be re-used. A new volume is created.

⚡️ It can not be shared across the containers.

To add anonymous volumes into Docker file
```
FROM base_image  

WORKDIR folder_path_and_name

COPY source destination

RUN some_command

EXPOSE port_number

VOLUME ["VOLUME_PATH_IN_THE_CONTAINER"] 

CMD run_app_command
```

To add anonymous volumes at the command 
```bash
 docker run -v VOLUME_PATH_IN_THE_CONTAINER IMAGE_NAME 
```

#### 🚀 Removing Anonymous Volumes
You create a container with *--rm* option then when you stop the container volume will be removed automatically.

On the other hand, if you dont use *--rm* option when creating a container, even if you stop and delete the container later  volume are not removed automatically and when you build the same image a new volume will be attached the new container so the old one will not be used and it will be exist.

To remove these volumes you can use remove commands as I metioned *Volumes Key Commands*

### Named volumes
⚡️ Named volumes persist even if the container is removed.

⚡️ It can be re-used for the same container.

⚡️ It can be shared across the containers.

To create named volumes
```bash
 docker run -v VOLUME_NAME:VOLUME_PATH_IN_THE_CONTAINER IMAGE_NAME
```

## Bind Mounts
⚡️ Developer sets up a path on the host machine and the exact path is known.

⚡️ It can be re-used for the same container.

⚡️ It can be shared across the containers.

⚡️ When you change your code, you can see the changes instantly without rebuild the image.

#### 🚀 Typical use-case
You want to provide latest data to the container without rebuilding image.

### Bind Mounts Key Commands
To add bind mounts commad is below. 
```bash
 docker run -v "ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_PROJECT_OR_FILE_ON_YOUR_MACHINE:VOLUME_PATH_IN_THE_CONTAINER" IMAGE_NAME
```
Make sure your folder or file which you are sharing is listed at Docker sharing file list. It shouldn't be list it exact path, listed parent folder is enough.

#### 🚀 File sharing
The File sharing tab is only available in Hyper-V mode(Settings --> Resources --> File Sharing), because in WSL 2 mode and Windows container mode all files are automatically shared by Windows.

#### 🚀 Shortcut of the full path of the project
```bash
 For windows        :   -v "%cd%":/app
 For macOS / Linux  :   -v $(pwd):/app
```
