## Images and Containers
Images are the blueprints.

Containers are executable units of software.


## Key Docker Commands


#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Creating
To build A Docker file and create an image
```
docker build .  
```

To create and start a container
```bash
docker run IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
```

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Naming and tagging
To assing a name and tag to your image
```
docker build -t NEW_IMAGE_NAME:NEW_IMAGE_TAG .  
```
To assing a name and to the container
```
docker run --name NEW_CONTAINER_NAME  
```

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Removing
To remove an image
```bash
 docker rmi IMAGE_ID
```

To remove an image forcefully (when you get an error as it is used by stopped container)
```bash
 docker rmi -f IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
```

To remove a container. 
```bash
 docker rm CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

To remove a container automatically when it's stopped. 
```bash
 docker run --rm IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
```


#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Interactive Mode
To want to use listening output and also entering input you can use interactive options.
```bash
  docker start -i CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
  docker run -i IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
```
#### ‚ö°Ô∏èInspection
To inspect an image
```bash
  docker inspect IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID
```

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Listing
For a full list of all commands 
```bash
docker --help
```

To list images
```bash
 docker images
```

To list just all running containers. 
```bash
 docker ps
```

To list all containers. 
```bash
 docker ps -a
```
#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Start and stop
To restart a container
```bash
 docker start CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

To stop a container. 
```bash
 docker stop CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Logging
To fetch the logs of a container. 
```bash
 docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
```


## Dockerize

### Dokerfile

Dockerfiles are text documents that allow you to build images for Docker.

Here is the basic Docker file structure

```
# First step : Base image which is a name Docker will be recognized and will start by pulling it.
FROM base_image  

# To tell the Docker execute all commands in this folder
WORKDIR folder_path_and_name

#Second step : To tell which files on your local machines shoul go into the image.
COPY source destination

#run a command in the image to get some dependencies.. etc if needed for running app.
RUN some_command

#Specify the running port but it is optional.
#You need to expose the port with -p when running the container.
EXPOSE port_number

#Then run your app
CMD run_app_command
```

### Spring Boot Docker File Example

Here is the Spring Boot dokerfile example

```
FROM openjdk:11.0  

WORKDIR /app

COPY ./target/hello-docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "hello-docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
```
### Building And Running Container

For my Spring Boot example you can find commands below.
```
docker build -t hello-docker . 
docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-docker
```


#### üöÄ Image Readonly
Everything in the images is read only then, and you can't edit it by simply updating your code. Hence you need to rebuild the image to pick up the changes.

#### üöÄ Image Layer 
Every instruction in your file creates a layer and these are cached. So when you rebuild your image it will be builded faster.
