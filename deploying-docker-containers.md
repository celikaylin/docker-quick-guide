# Deploying Docker Containers

This document includes deployment of an application to the Docker containers on AWS with basic/simple configurations for one project.

## Using AWS EC2

It is an virtual servers in the cloud which basically means our own computer in the cloud. At this service you need **you do everyting manually**.


### Deploying An Application

- Create an acoount on AWS.

- Follow [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) to create an instance at AWS EC2.

- Try to connect to your instance follow [this document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html).

- [Create an image](https://github.com/celikaylin/docker-quick-guide/blob/main/images-and-containers.md#key-docker-commands) and [push it to the Dockerhub](https://github.com/celikaylin/docker-quick-guide/blob/main/images-and-containers.md#pushing-image-to-docker-hub)

- Go to SSH terminal

- Ensure that all essential packages on the remote machine are up to date 
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

- Install extra software like Docker
```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
```

- Start the service
```bash
sudo service docker start
```
- Create and start the container
```bash
sudo docker run -d --rm -p 80:80 DOCKER_HUB_IMAGE_NAME
```

- Find the `Public IPv4 address` then browse the app
```bash
http://Public_IPv_address/
```

#### ðŸš€ It doesn't work but why?
Now your app is up, but when you browse the application you can not access it because the http traffic is not allowed for now. Find the `Security groups` of the instance then check `Inbound rules`. Here you will see just one rule which is allowed just for SSH traffic over through port 22. But we need HTTP traffic too. 

- Find the securitygroup of the launch instance then create a new `Inbound rule` . Attributes should be like this.
```bash
Type    :   HTTP
Source  :   Anywhere
```

#### ðŸš€ Security Group 
*Outbound Rules* control which trafic is allowed from launch queue to somewhere.

*Inbound Rules* control which trafic is allowed from somewhere in the launch queue.

#### ðŸš€ Why *.pem file is important
SSH traffic is open entire world. So it means entire world be able to connect the app over through` port 22` but you are the one be able to connect it successfully by `*.pem` file.

- Try to browse your app again and it works.


### Updating The Application 

- On your local machine update the project and build the image as before.

- Push it to the `Docker Hub` again

- Go to SSH terminal and stop the container.

- [Pull the image](https://github.com/celikaylin/docker-quick-guide/blob/main/images-and-containers.md#pulling-image-from-docker-hub) (Here is important you should not run `run` command firstly because it will not fetch the latest version of the image it looks locally and if exists uses it). 

- Create and start the container by using `run` command as earlier.


## Using AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

This service helps us for managing containers by **automatically**. It gives you less control and less responsibility.

### Deploying An Application

- Go to [here](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=eu-central-1#/firstRun) to start creating a new container.

- Choose `custom configure` option. And enter the name and public repo infos. Then click next for task and service until seeing create button and on click Create then it will take a bit time.

- When finised everything you will see `View Service` button and click on it.

- Go to `Task` tab and click on the running task to go detail then you will see `Public IP` into the `Network` section. Browse it and then it works.


### Updating The Application 

- On your local machine update the project and `build` the image as before.

- Push it to the `Docker Hub` again.

- Go to `Service` and click on the `Update` button. Then click on the `Update Service` button without changing something then your application fill be updated.
